## Description
A feature-rich Unity networking solution aimed towards reliability, ease of use, efficiency, and flexibility. Developed by a professional game designer, supported by the community.

This repository is set up to support local development, import as a Unity Project or install via Unity Package Manager. The recomended method of installation is to use Unity Package Manager as this reduces risk of installation error, and simplifies import of related tools. You can however clone this repository and open the [Unity Project](https://github.com/heathen-engineering/FishNet/tree/main/Unity%20Project) folder as a Unity Project via the Unity Hub. You can also choose to copy and paste only the required folder [com.firstgeargames.fishnet](https://github.com/heathen-engineering/FishNet/tree/main/Unity%20Project/Assets/com.firstgeargames.fishnet) which is similar to what Unity Package Manager would do for you.

Note that if you do choose to copy the [com.firstgeargames.fishnet](https://github.com/heathen-engineering/FishNet/tree/main/Unity%20Project/Assets/com.firstgeargames.fishnet) in manually you will need to change the names of the Sample and Plugin folder to remove the ~ character. This character will cause Unity to ignore those folders and so they will not show in editor. These are here to allow UPM (Unity Package Manager) to import these on demand as part of the samples in the Package Manager drop down.
